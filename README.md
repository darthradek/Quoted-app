# Quoted-app

MEN REST API Assignment Quoted – quote generator that consists of:
• REST API made with Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB +
swagger documentation, deployed on heroku.

• Vanilla js front-end made with tailwind.css that hits
getAllRoutes end-point, deployed on netlify


Front-end:
 Deployment: https://reverent-archimedes-6b90f3.netlify.app
 Repo: https://github.com/darthradek/Quoted-app
 
 Back-end:
 Deployment:https://quoted-app.herokuapp.com/
 Swagger:https://quoted-app.herokuapp.com/api/docs/
 Github:https://github.com/darthradek/Quoted-AP

Personal insights:
This assignment helped me to understand not only how to build custom node.js REST API, but also how to establish it’s automated deployment environment. I also learned how to integrate it in exemplary front-end, which is deployed on separate server. After making the API, I can see potential for a lot of architectural improvements as well as using typescript instead of javascript, which I am gonna try in upcoming projects.
